# las_rocket_project
A repository for design files for the maker's workshop at LAS.

## Recommended software

To use the files in this repository, I recommend that you open the .ork file using [openrocket](https://openrocket.info/) which will allow you to view and modify the rocket design.

To create new nosecone designs, use the nosecone_factory.scad file, which can be opened with [openscad](https://openscad.org/). Scad format allows you to define .stl files in code, which makes it much easier to create parametrisable versions of things like nosecone designs.

Note that that nosecone is designed to be printed in PLA, with a wall thickness of 0.2mm, and with an infill density of 20%.

The nosecone_factory.scad is not my own work, but was created by Thingiverse user TZT, and is used here under Creative Commons - Attribution license.
